KrizCode has evolved into a **full-featured, professional, browser-based development environment** powered by **Monaco Editor** (the same editor used in VS Code).  
This is not just an HTML editor anymore — it’s a complete **mini workspace** for creating, saving, loading, and managing web projects directly in your browser.
