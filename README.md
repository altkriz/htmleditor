# ⚡ KrizVibe Editor — The Future of Vibe Coding with AI

KrizVibe Editor is a next-generation **web-based coding environment** built for creators, learners, and developers who want to build websites visually, interactively, and intelligently.

Powered by **KrizVibe AI** — our integrated AI website-generation assistant — the editor merges traditional hand-coding with AI-assisted “vibe coding”, enabling complete websites to be generated instantly and injected directly into HTML, CSS, and JavaScript editors.

KrizVibe Editor is **free**, **open-source**, and uses the **Pollinations OpenAI-compatible API** — no API key, no credit card, no rate limits.

## 🤖 KrizVibe AI — How It Works

KrizVibe AI uses the Pollinations OpenAI-Compatible endpoint to generate structured web code.

### Example API Request:
```json
{
  "model": "openai",
  "temperature": 1.0,
  "max_tokens": 1500,
  "messages": [
    {
      "role": "system",
      "content": "You are KrizVibe AI, a professional website-generation assistant. Always output exactly three sections using [HTML], [CSS], [JS] — no explanations."
    },
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "Create a landing page with a hero, features, and footer."
    }
  ]
}
````

### Expected Response Format:

```
[HTML]
<!-- html code here -->

[CSS]
/* css code here */

KrizVibe Editor automatically extracts these 3 sections and inserts them directly into the Monaco editor.
